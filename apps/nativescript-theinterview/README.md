# Theinterview

So you think you a ready to work on some nativescript code, lets see what you got!

## Mobile App

To build and run the nativescript app, you will need to follow the nativescript [environment setup](https://docs.nativescript.org/environment-setup.html)

- Run `nx run nativescript-theinterview:ios` for iOS simulator.
- Run `nx run nativescript-theinterview:android` for Android emulator.

If running into issues:
Start by running `ns doctor` from the this directory to see which pieces of your dev environment are missing to build for iOS or Android. If you run this command from root, you will be missing some packages that are only installed at the app level.

## Number 1

Navigate to libs/xplat/features/src/lib/my-feature/state/feature.selector.ts

- We are asking you to write a function to complete the selector
- EST TIME TO COMPLETE: 15min
